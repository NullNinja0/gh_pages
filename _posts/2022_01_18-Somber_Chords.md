A question you may ask yourself, "What are the best chords to use for a dark sounding Hip-Hop inspired instrumental?"

    Minor chords: Minor chords tend to sound darker and more ominous than major chords, so using a progression of minor chords can help create a darker atmosphere. For example, you might try using a progression of minor chords like Cm, Fm, and Gm.
    Suspended chords: Suspended chords, such as sus2 and sus4 chords, can add an unsettling, dissonant quality to your instrumental. Try using sus2 or sus4 chords in combination with minor chords to add some darkness to your progression.
    Diminished chords: Diminished chords are formed by stacking minor thirds on top of each other, and they can add a tense, unsettling quality to your instrumental. You might try using a diminished chord like Bdim7 or Edim7 in your progression.
    Augmented chords: Augmented chords, which are formed by stacking major thirds on top of each other, can also add an unsettling quality to your instrum

What are diminished chords and what does it mean to 'stack minor thirds on top of each other?'

A diminished chord is a chord that is made up of a root note, a minor third interval above the root, and a diminished fifth interval above the root. The interval between the root and the minor third is a minor third interval, which is three half steps (or three frets on a guitar). The interval between the root and the diminished fifth is a diminished fifth interval, which is six half steps (or six frets on a guitar).
For example, if you were building a diminished chord starting on the note C, you would start with C as the root, then add an E♭ (which is a minor third above C) and a G♭ (which is a diminished fifth above C). This would give you the chord Cdim, which is spelled C-E♭-G♭.
You can build a diminished chord starting on any root note by following this formula: root + minor third + diminished fifth. For example, if you wanted to build a diminished chord starting on G, you would use the notes G-B♭-D♭ to form the chord Gdim, which is spelled G-B♭-D♭.

Here is an example using Minor and Suspended Chords:

Verse 1:

    Cm (C-E♭-G)
    Fm (F-A♭-C)
    Gm (G-B♭-D)
    Cm (C-E♭-G)
    Fsus2 (F-G-C)
    Gsus2 (G-A-D)
    Cm (C-E♭-G)
    Fm (F-A♭-C)

Verse 2:

    Cm (C-E♭-G)
    Fm (F-A♭-C)
    Gm (G-B♭-D)
    Cm (C-E♭-G)
    Fsus2 (F-G-C)
    Gsus2 (G-A-D)
    Cm (C-E♭-G)
    Fm (F-A♭-C)

This chord progression uses a repeating pattern of minor chords (Cm, Fm, Gm) followed by suspended chords (Fsus2, Gsus2) to create a dark, ominous atmosphere with some dissonance and tension. You can try using this chord progression as a starting point and then adding in additional chords or variations to create your own unique sound.
